Priests of the Tree will be granted a sacred branch taken from a tree hewn by men as a symbol of their hatred of civilization. In battle insects will swarm forth from the rotten branch to attack their enemies. The spirit can inhabit willing or unwilling subjects by infesting them with a swarm of insects, allowing it to perform tasks such as forging items.

Priests preaching at the great cathedrals of the Bush have a chance to attract an angel from the Celestial realm which will descend to serve the spirit. The bush burns continually with a great heat that will sear any that get too close.

The spirit cannot leave the statue, but it can possess willing targets in order to make its will heard and to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. When the servants of the idol perform a blood sacrifice the soul of the victim will be trapped in this realm and forced to serve the priest as its master. The spirit is tremendously strong in its dominion. In a physical battle, the idol would be difficult to destroy, even though it cannot strike back.

#descr "The Great Wise Whale was born at the dawn of time and was one of the first beings to swim in the primordial deeps. When the previous Pantokrator rose to power it sank to the bottom of the ocean in a deep slumber. Over time it has grown larger, wiser and stronger and now it has come to claim the mantle of Godhood. The song of the whale will travel to underwater provinces throughout its Dominion and bring comfort to its followers, reducing unrest and increasing productivity, whilst the blessing of the whale will impart some of its great resilience. The Whale remembers everything that has occurred in the world and it is said its death will herald the end of time itself.

Dominion grants Underwater provinces approx +1% tax and -1 unrest per candle
Blessing gains +10hp once Awakens

The spirit uses powerful death magic to keep the corpse animated and in a state of unnatural undeath as it roams the seas. This magic will also animate nearby corpses, long dead creatures of the deep and even those the Carcass kills in battle. The magic is so strong that anyone close to the creature will have their life force drained and used to restore the health and endurance of the Carcass. The great bulk of the creature makes it difficult to destroy, however the bones are brittle.

The Emissary will allow mages to summon banefire servants from the Underworld, and in the capital mages will gather to learn its secrets. Its only weakness is the bond with the Underworld, which makes it possible for priests to banish the creature. As a creature of Antrax the Emissary is surrounded by poisonous banefire and is strong in the magic of the Underworld.

Capital Temple allows recruiting Banefire adepts (D1F1 +100%D/F, can summon 1 Banefire Child at a temple each month)
Temples outside capital will create a Banefire Brazier (1 Death gem, 1 Fire gem, increase Heat and Death)
If Antrax present with Emissary, breaks free from summoning circle (becomes mobile) and Antrax summons 3D6 Banefire Children and Banefire Child commander (1F + 50% D) each month

Summoned to this world by its followers using a powerful summoning circle, it has now been brought forth from the circle of summoning by the King of Banefires. The Emissary will summon more banefire servants from the Underworld as its dominion grows strong, and in the capital mages will gather to learn its secrets. Its only weakness is the bond with the Underworld, which makes it possible for priests to banish the creature. As a creature of Antrax the Emissary is surrounded by poisonous banefire and is strong in the magic of the Underworld.

Capital temple allows Death mage to summon 3 Banefire Children
Capital Temple allows recruiting Banefire adepts (D1F1, 100%D/F, can summon 1 Banefire Child at a temple each month)
Temples outside capital will create a Banefire Brazier (1 Death gem, 1 Fire gem, increase Heat and Death)
If control Antrax will break free from summoning circle (becomes mobile) and gain 3D6 Banefire Children each month

Summoned to this world by its followers using a powerful summoning circle, it has now amassed enough power to claim the title of God itself.

The Spirit can summon devils from the Inferno, and as its dominion grows strong and the Thrones of Heaven fall into its grasp infernal servants will arrive in great numbers. The spirit will attempt to cajole its servants into entering into unholy pacts for wealth and power. The bond with the Inferno grants it great power, however it also makes it possible for magic to banish the creature from this world.

The Divine Egg is infused with the magic of new life, and around it living things will grow and heal at an amazing rate and will cease to age. With the Pantokrator gone, its powers have begun to manifest themselves and it is now worshiped as a reawakening god. The Egg cannot move, but it can possess willing targets in order to make its will heard and to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. The Egg is tremendously strong in its dominion. In a physical battle, the Egg would be difficult to destroy, even though it cannot strike back.

Egg and its Prophet prevent aging in the province & local province gains approx 25 population per candle each month
Capital population increased by 5,000 if awake
After turn 20 may transform into a new form (5% x candles chance per month, Dragon, Wyrm, Neter of the Sun, Solar Eagle or Golden Lion on land or Ancient Kraken, Sea Dragon or Protogenos of the Sea if UW)

#descr "The Blood Soaked Edifice is a powerful spirit that inhabits a huge standing stone. Once a pure spirit of the Earth, it has been tainted by foul blood rituals. As the ground was soaked with sacrificial blood the spirit gained a craving for the blood of the innocent. The ground itself around the edifice will rise up in a corrupted form to serve the spirit as its dominion grows stronger. The spirit cannot leave the Edifice, but it can possess the weak willed in order to make its will heard and to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. When performing a Blood Sacrifice to the spirit the blood is poured onto the earth in the hopes of creating an Illearth, and this is more likely to succeed as the Dominion of the spirit grows strong. The spirit is tremendously strong in its dominion and it is also magically powerful.  In a physical battle, the stone would be difficult to destroy, even though it cannot strike back.

Summons Illearths each month up to Dominion candles
Monkey nations gain starting commanders: 3 Asrapa priestesses
Temples where Infernal Circle cast or a priest is performing a Blood Sacrifice may summon a size 6 Illearth (Candles x 10% chance)
While controls Earth Blood Deep Well, gain Blood Rock site in capital (30% Blood Discount)

#descr "The Spirit of Bones is an ancient spirit of nature created to impose the cycle of life and death upon the world in ages past. Once the cycle was in place its services were no longer needed and the spirit was bound beneath the earth for eternity. Over the centuries many animals and men have traveled to the site of the spirits imprisonment to die, and now a great pile of bones and skulls marks the place where the spirit is bound. With the Pantokrator gone, its powers have begun to manifest themselves and it is now worshiped as a reawakening god. The spirit cannot leave its spiritual home, but it can possess willing targets in order to make its will heard and to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. As its dominion grows strong vines will strangle the life from the living and animate their corpses to serve it. In a physical battle, the bone pile would be difficult to destroy, even though it cannot strike back.

Summons Carrion Beasts & Manikins up to Dominion candles, 2 Mandragora & reanimates up to 10 corpses each month
Increases Growth Limit by +6 (Must take Growth 4 or 5)

#descr "The Statue of the Silent God is a primordial spirit that once served a previous Pantokrator. Little is known about the spirit or its purpose and it never speaks about this to its followers. For reasons unknown the spirit was bound in a huge stone statue for eternity by the Pantokrator and its name was expunged from all written records. With the Pantokrator gone, its powers have begun to manifest themselves and it is now once more worshiped as a reawakening god. The temples of the Silent God are strange places where the air seems thick with unspoken words and inhuman noises are heard at night. Each month magical pearls will form and slaves of pure blood will be brought for nameless rituals. Magic will be stronger and rituals of Blood will be easier at these temples, however unfortunate events seem to occur more often, and there is the sense of being watched by alien eyes. The spirit cannot leave the statue, but it can possess willing targets to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. The spirit is tremendously strong in its dominion. In a physical battle, the statue would be difficult to destroy, even though it cannot strike back.

Silent Temples appear at temples (1 pearl, 1 slave, spread Misfortune & Magic, Blood discount 10%, spreads Horror Marks (4% per commander), +3 Unrest per month)
Increases Magic and Misfortune limits by +2
Summons Soultorn Horrors up to candles each month
While awake, a Soultorn Horror may appear when a priest preaches at a temple (10% x candles chance, extra chance at magic 3+; 1 priest per province)

#descr "The Protean Abomination is a horrid, grayish-green protean pool that has existed since the dawn of time. It was created to bring life to the world, however it became corrupted and was imprisoned for eternity in the deepest part of the world. With the Pantokrator gone, its powers have begun to manifest again and it is worshiped as a reawakening god. Misshapen creatures constantly form in the mass and crawl away from it, their forms ranging from amorphous blobs and singular body parts, to humanoids and monstrous mutants. It is said to be the ultimate source of all miscreation and abomination in the world. The pool has many tentacles and limbs that grab and devour nearby creatures. At each of its temples a small portion of the thing is kept and used to create more misshapen beings by its foul priests as its Dominion grows strong. As its influence spreads to the Thrones of Heaven even they will become corrupted and will birth formless horrors. The creature has a twisted and cynical mind, and can communicate telepathically with those nearby. It will not stop until the entire world is corrupted by miscreation.

Casts Mind Warp in battles (25% of units must resist with MR or suffer Confusion and +10 Insanity, mindless or those with Void Sanity are immune)
Summons hybrid creatures each month up to Dominion candles and 1 sacred Formless Spawn
Each month 1 sacred Formless Spawn and 10D6 crossbreeds will appear at each Throne in friendly Dominion
Temples may summon 3D6 Foul Spawn (Candles x 10% chance) or 1 sacred Formless Spawn (Candles x 5% chance)

#descr "The Idol of the Harvest is a primordial spirit of nature that once served a previous Pantokrator. When he saw how the spirit was venerated by the common folk he had it bound in a huge golden statue for eternity. With the Pantokrator gone, its powers have begun to manifest themselves and it is now worshiped by mages of Nature as a reawakening god. The spirit cannot leave the statue, but it can possess willing targets in order to make its will heard and to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. The spirit is tremendously strong in its dominion. In the autumn months the lands around the temples of the idol will reap a bountiful harvest and may generate more tax income than usual. In a physical battle, the statue would be difficult to destroy, even though it cannot strike back.

While awake, temples generate +25% tax & 1D6 nature gems during Fall months
Growth limit increased by +2
Nature mages gain H1 if not already priests

The spirit is tremendously strong in its dominion and it is also almost impossible to affect with magic, which it will grant to its followers. Mental emanations from the statue will attract strange creatures from the Void, as well as the weak willed as its dominion grows strong. The statue is deeply unsettling and although it cannot strike back in combat it will drain the life essence of those nearby and enemies may flee rather than face it.

With the Pantokrator gone, the Living Reef can manifest its full power to become the True God. The reef is tremendously strong in its dominion although it cannot move. In a physical battle, the reef would be difficult to destroy, even though it cannot strike back. The reef provides a great quantity of coral, which can be used to create weapons and armor. It is served by the Reef Guard, a colony of Atlantians bedecked in Coral and sacred to the followers of the Reef. It is surrounded by shoals of fish that will aid its servants, and occasionally larger fish will appear from the depths.

#descr "After the death of the Prophet his remains were kept in the temple of the Holy City of Eldregate and venerated as relics while the nation awaited the coming of the mysteryous New God he had promised. Replicas of the shrouds he wore were made and used by his most devoted followers to heal the sick and wounded, and faithful from all around the Empire made pilgrimages to to Eldregate to offer prayers and sacrifices to the Prophet's tomb. As the focus of such devotion the Reliquary gained great spiritual power. One day as many followers of the New Faith were praying it suddenly began to shine with celestial light. More and stronger miracles manifested, and it was clear a powerful spirit had bound itself to the remains. The Bishops were quick to declare the New God they had been waiting for had awakened, and it was the Prophet himself who had ascended to the Celestial sphere after his death to wait for the time when the faith of the people would be strong enough to call him back to the world, and make him into the God he had promised. Now Ermor follows the Second Coming of the Prophet, confident that he will lead the Empire to glory and dominion over the whole world. With the appearance of the Lord the faith has spread, and now Equites and Bishops of the Shroud are trained throughout the empire. As the Thrones of Heaven are claimed by the True God Equites will gather at their sites to worship and offer fealty.

Equites of the shroud recruitable in forts

The goal was resurrect the Prophet, for many had come to believe that he would bring an age of wealth and prosperity where Ermor held ultimate dominion over the world. However the ritual failed catastrophically: there was no resurrection but rather the spiritual barriers between the worlds of the dead and the living were shattered and Death was brought forth, killing tens of thousands. Now a powerful spirit of the Underworld is bound to the Prophet's tomb, turning the land to ash and desolation as its dominion spread. The Unholy Reliquary is surrounded by a terrifying life-draining aura and because of its close connection to the Underworld generates Death gems every month. It can raise the Knights of the Unholy Sepulchre to serve it and more will appear as it seizes the Thrones of Heaven.

With the Pantokrator gone, its powers have begun to manifest themselves and it is now worshiped as a reawakening god.

The grove is lush and will grant greater blessings of nature and water than would normally be available to it, however it is completely immobile and cannot move even by magic. Animals will congregate at the temples of the Grove as its Dominion grows strong and can be commanded by its Priests.

The spirit cannot leave the statue, but it can possess willing targets in order to make its will heard and to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. The spirit is tremendously strong in its Dominion. Each month it will create magical gems of earth and nature magic for use by its followers. The Statue can bestow greater blessings of Earth and Nature on its followers than would otherwise be expected. In a physical battle, the statue would be difficult to destroy, even though it cannot strike back.

#descr "The Divine Anvil is a primordial spirit of creation bound into a large anvil that once taught the people of the world the secret of ironworking. When the Pantokrator saw the smoke from the forges of men he flew into a rage and sealed the Divine Anvil away in the deepest reaches of the earth. Now with the Pantokrator gone, its powers have begun to manifest themselves once more. The spirit cannot leave the anvil, but it can possess willing targets in order to make its will heard and to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. Items created using the Anvil require half as many gems as usual due to the Divine spirit, and the spirit will gift its followers with 3 wondrous hammers that can be used in the forge. The spirit is tremendously strong in its dominion. In a physical battle the anvil would be difficult to destroy, however the heat from the forge will rise to unbearable levels and will soon render any combatants that are not protected unconscious.

Casts Heat from Hell in battles
Productivity limit increased by +2 (Provinces with Production 4+ lose 5 unrest each month)
Starting items: 3 x Dwarven Hammers
Each month awake spirit may possess a willing servant and create a magic item (Candles x 5% chance each month, items created may be more powerful over time: can be constr 3 starting from turn 19 and can be constr 7 after turn 37)

Through the ages the Stone Tyrant has accumulated a huge amount of offerings and it has grown in power so it can rival the mightiest of arch mages. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the Stone Tyrant has the chance of putting the world under its strong dominion and becoming the True God. The spirit cannot leave the chiseled stone, but it can possess willing targets in order to make its will heard and to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. The spirit is tremendously strong in its Dominion and will strike terror into the hearts of its enemies. The weapons it produces include some magical items.

The people of Ulm worshipped it as a symbol of the power of human ingenuity and made it their own god and idol. In time it gained a semblance of will and began to move under its own power. The Colossus is mindless and mostly does what its worshipers believe it would do. It punishes harshly and rewards sparingly. The Colossus is extremely hard to destroy and, while slow, can tirelessly crush lesser foes with its great fists. Other automatons moving by the will of the Colossus will be blessed by the Priests of Ulm and gain priestly powers, speaking the will of the Lord.

#descr "When the Earth Made Flesh was imprisoned for eternity her children mourned her loss. The Pale Ones decided to create a great statue in her honour, crafted from onyx in memory of her sacrifice. The statue was adorned with gold and placed in the Chamber of the Seal to guard over the great evil contained within. Over centuries the Pale Ones came to worship the statue as if it was the Earth Made Flesh herself and eventually it began to move. Some Oracles claim the statue is inhabited by the spirit of the banished progenitor, others say it moves only by the will of the Pale Ones. All agree it speaks with the voice of God. The Onyx Statue is made of stone and would be difficult to destroy in combat. As it speaks, other statues in the ancient halls may begin to speak and move, and will soon gain power over earth and stone.

The Oracle is immobile and cannot leave the spring it inhabits. It can possess willing targets to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. The Oracle is tremendously strong in its Dominion and magically powerful.

The spring can be destroyed, but not easily.

When the final decree was set, its services were no longer needed and the spirit was bound in a huge stone statue for eternity. With the Pantokrator gone, its powers have begun to manifest themselves and it is now worshiped as a reawakening god.

The chosen child is blinded and rendered unable to do anything but speak the will of the spirit. At the age of thirteen, she is sacrificed and replaced with a new girl, born the day the previous girl was made the voice of the spirit. The unholy spirit is immobile and cannot leave the fountain it inhabits. It can possess willing targets to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. The Fountain of Blood is tremendously strong in its Dominion and magically powerful. Its eerie wails attract weak souls and as its Dominion grows strong more and more people will be drawn from the surrounding provinces ready for sacrifice. Even the recently dead will rise at the sound, allowing their blood to be harvested. Anyone wishing to harm the fountain will flee in panic once the eerie wailing pierces his soul, and the rain of blood that accompanies it will shake the strongest soul. The fountain can be destroyed, but not easily.

In battles casts Blood Rain
Blood Fountains province provides 10% blood discount
Summons a Sanguine Horror (Size 8 regenerating and crushing mass of blood) if blood hunting, rare chanse to spawn additional one for free in strong dominion

#selectmonster 2461 -- Statue of the Bloody Mother
#descr "The Statue of the Bloody Mother is the spirit of a goddess of birth and blood once slain and bound in a huge stone statue by a previous Pantokrator. With the Pantokrator gone, its will and its thirst for blood are reawakened. The spirit cannot leave the statue, but it can possess willing targets in order to make its will heard and when searching for sacrifices many will answer the call. The spirit is tremendously strong in its Dominion and will increase fertility throughout the province. In a physical battle, the statue would be difficult to destroy, even though it cannot strike back. The blessings of the Mother will imbue great vitality and heartiness into her subjects in addition to any other blessings chosen.

#descr "The Golden Idol is an ancient spirit bound to a statue of a golden calf. Millennia of worship and bloody sacrifices has made the Idol powerful and now with the Pantokrator gone, the spirit will claim dominion over the entire world and become the one True God. The spirit will shower its followers with riches and rewards whilst it is in the world, to better command their attentions. The strange power of the idol may convert any followers of false Gods that rise against it into docile followers. The priesthood carry idols in imitation of their God, and even these have the power to convert those that worship other Pretenders. The power of the Idol will claim any Throne captured by its followers within friendly Dominion without the need for a priest, and a golden temple will appear to spread the word of the Lord.

#descr "When the earth was formed the Pantokrator placed a huge pillar at the Roots of the Earth as foundation for the creation and endowed it with vast powers. In time the pillar was discovered by the first pale ones and they began to worship the pillar. Over the millennia they gave it their devotion and their trust and the pillar became sentient and wise. It foresaw the fate of the race that had given it consciousness and it was saddened with grief. When the Pantokrator disappeared the Pillar decided that it would change the fate of the pale ones and make them forge their own destiny. Creatures from the deepest roots of the earth will emerge to serve the Pillar as its Dominion grows strong. These Pale Ones are sacred to the people of Agartha. Should the Pillar ever be disturbed a great earthquake will wrack the surface world, destroying many buildings and releasing creatures from the depths of the earth.

Summons Cave Grubs & Crabs up to Dominion candles, occasionally summons a Cave Cow or Troglodyte
Cave temples may spawn 1D3 Cave Grubs & 1 Cave Cow (10% x candles chance)
Increases Luck limit by +2 (Provinces with Luck 4+ gain +5% income)

#descr "Huacas, 'sacred ones', were semi-divine beings of an earlier age and the ancestors of the Nazcans. Their power was broken by the previous Pantokrator and most fled to the Celestial Sphere ages ago. A few of them remained in this world but were gradually turned to stone. The Stone Huaca is one of these petrified Huacas that has become a shrine and a place of worship for the Nazcan people. Once among the most powerful of the Huacas the Petrified One is now breaking free from the Pantokrator's curse and ready to lead the Nazcan people to world domination. Its Dominion is strong, and whilst within it the priests of the Stone Huaca can tempt Supaya, the spirits of dead Huaca, to appear by preaching at a temple. Stronger Priests or temples located on mountaintops will have a greater chance for a Supaya to appear. Occasionally a Huaca will return to serve their petrified ancestor as its Dominion grows stronger.

Priests can summon a Supaya by preaching at temple (40% chance/priest level or 80% at Mountain)

The Protogenos of the Sea manifests itself as a huge bearded head rising up from the waves. It is crowned with crab claws on its brow as a sign of its divine nature. It is strongly connected to the sea and will instruct the sea in battle to attack its enemies, causing elementals to appear as the battle rages. It is magically powerful, however it can never leave its ocean home unless the sea were to rise to claim the land. The Protogenos is the spirit of the sea, and will resent attempts by false Pretenders to wrest control of its Domain. Should a Maelstrom be created it will siphon its essence, stealing a portion of the gems created. Should the sea be frozen, shards of ice will animate and attack the coasts until the spell is ended.

In battle constantly summons size 3 Water Elementals
Cannot leave the sea unless controls Wrath of the Sea
If Maelstrom is cast, Protogenos steals 3D6 W gems from caster each month
Whilst Sea of Ice is cast, Ice elementals will attack coastal provinces owned by other nations (20% chance per month for attack by 3-10 Ice Elementals)

#descr "The Statue of the Underworld is a primordial spirit of the underworld that was brought to this world by a previous Pantokrator to watch over the final phase of the cycle of life and death. When the cycle was set, its services were no longer needed and the spirit was bound in a huge stone statue for eternity. With the Pantokrator gone, its powers have begun to manifest themselves and it is now worshiped as a reawakening god. Fossilized warriors buried deep in the earth are now beginning to stir and will emerge to serve the statue as its Dominion grows strong. The spirit cannot leave the statue, but it can possess willing targets in order to make its will heard and to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. The spirit is tremendously strong in its Dominion and can grant blessings of Death more powerful than would be expected otherwise. In a physical battle, the statue would be difficult to destroy, even though it cannot strike back. Spirits and Lords of the Underworld are honoured as priests of the statue, and occasionally a Kokythiad will follow the great river to emerge at the statue.

Starting Commander: Released King
Summons Released Ones and Released Warriors up to Dominion candles
Statue will summon a Kokythiad each mid winter, additional one will be summoned for each death scale in province
Spirits & Lords of the Underworld will gain H2 (Banes, Kokythiads, Lampads, Ker & Wraith Lords)

#selectmonster 3344 -- Statue of Beginnings
#descr "The Statue of Beginnings is a primordial spirit of order that once served a previous Pantokrator to bring life and civilization to the world. When the final decree was set, its services were no longer needed and the spirit was bound in a huge stone statue for eternity. With the Pantokrator gone, its powers have begun to manifest themselves and it is now worshiped as a Reawakening God. The spirit cannot leave the statue, but it can possess willing targets in order to make its will heard and to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. The spirit has great knowledge of city planning and architecture and can instruct its followers to improve the level of forts within the province. The spirit is tremendously strong in its Dominion. In a physical battle, the statue would be difficult to destroy, even though it cannot strike back. Any nation lead by the statue will begin the game more wealthy than usual, gaining around a thousand pounds of gold and several magical items in the treasury. The tax collectors of the Statue will be very efficient, and will be able to collect more tax from each province within its Dominion as it grows stronger.

Starting bonus: +1000 gold, 3 random magic items
Whilst Order scales present gain approx 1% income per candle
Can improve forts by 1 level using Mason ability
Can teach commanders present in magic paths up to level 2 (2% x candles chance per W/E/S path per month)

Once the task was completed the Pantokrator had no need of the spirit and it was confined to a Tabernacle. This, however, did not deter its worshipers who proceeded to construct a great temple around the Tabernacle. Upon noticing this the Pantokrator had his followers destroy the temple in a fit of rage and banished the Lord of the Heavens to the celestial realm where he could not affect the mortal world. Now, with the Pantokrator gone the spirit has returned and will once more take command of the world it created. The followers of the Lord will rebuild his temple and spread word of his return across the land. The spirit has a very strong Dominion and the rebuilt temple will spread Dominion as effectively as five regular temples. It appears as an old bearded man born aloft by clouds and can call lightning from the heavens to smite its enemies. Three Divine Guardians protect the spirit, manifesting as beings of brass surrounded by clouds of fire, and more may appear as his Dominion grows strong.

He was given power over the water of the land and the deeps by a previous Pantokrator, however he misused his power to bring floods and devastation. The Pantokrator saw what his servant had wrought and set a great warrior to bind him. The battle that followed raged for many days and nights and ended with one of the pillars of heaven being knocked, tilting the land off its axis and causing all rivers to flow to the southeast. After being imprisoned at the bottom of the ocean he has now begun to stir once more. The Lord of Floods can travel below the waves and is feared by all living beings. Now he seeks to become the True God and the world will tremble. The priests of the Lord will enact rituals to mitigate the misfortune brought by his presence.

Now it has awoken and its hunger has returned. The Terror of the Deep is amphibian and can leave its watery home when required. It rarely communicates with its followers, however if displeased it opens its enormous mouth and swallows the unfortunate whole. Now it is out to become the true God, to consume all others that stand in its path and perhaps even the Thrones of Heaven themselves.

If present at a Throne will attempt to consume it utterly, reducing scoring requirements by its value (33% chance per month of success)
Whilst at a Throne will produce 3D6 gems of each type each month until Throne is consumed

He shares much of his father's power and appearance, manifesting as a being of molten rock constantly surrounded by heat and flames. He can summon beings of magma to serve him and aid in battle, but yearns for the worship of the people of the world and has decided to claim Godhood. In combat the creature will manifest magical Fire gems to aid in spellcasting. The Dominion of the Firstborn will be a hellish place, with magma running openly from sulphurous vents and even long-extinct volcanoes may sputter back to life.

Summons Magma Children up to Dominion candles each month
Increases Heat limit by +3, provinces with Heat 3+ scales may create Magma Pools (1F1E, 1% x candles chance) and Volcanoes (3F, 2% chance in each Mountain with any candles)
Volcano sites may generate 1D6 Sacred Lava Warriors each month (10% x candles chance)
In battles gains 3 temporary Fire gems

#descr "The Antumbral is a powerful shadow being that was once the soul of a great Agarthan mage. In ages past it sacrificed itself to seal the Chamber, however now it has returned to this realm as the seal weakens to lead its brethren. It seeks to attain the role of Pantokrator from beyond the grave to enact revenge on the surface races. The Antumbral is served by Umbrals that will appear when his Dominion grows strong. Umbrals are shadow beings resembling ancient Pale Ones with elongated faces and drooling mouths. They are ethereal, undead beings capable of draining life from the living. The priesthood of the Antumbral bear special pendants that connect them to the underworld, and using these they can imbue undead beings with power.

Each month summons Penumbrals up to half Dominion candles
May call 3 Umbrals each month
Priests gain Shadow Pendant item (+50 Und. Ldr, Darkpower 3, casts Unholy Power)

#descr "At the dawn of time, on the sacred mount Hermon, descended six angels in full celestial splendor to the natives of the holy land to aid and instruct them in righteousness and wisdom. The Avvim were a people strong and beautiful of mind and body. They were adept students and their culture flourished under the tutelage of the Watchers. But before long the Grigori became enamored with the Avvim, shared their burdens and taught them things that should not be taught. Tempted by the beauty of the Avvim, they took their daughters as wives and sinned before the Celestial Powers. Their offspring were the Nephilim, giants of great power, abominable to the world. When the Celestial Powers lashed out in fury, the Grigori were banished to the infernal realms. Now, with the Pantokrator gone one of the Grigori can feel his shackles weakening and will return to the world to claim the mantle of Godhood.

He reasoned a being of light should not bow before a creature of the dust. At this the other angels cried out and called him a Devil and a Heretic. The Pantokrator however praised him for seeing the truth and bade him sit at the side of the Throne of Heaven.

As the people of the world saw the life giving rays of the sun they began to worship it above the Pantokrator and he grew jealous of his child. He imprisoned the Sun Father along with his two offspring in a pit from which no light could escape and gave the task of driving the Sun Chariot to another. Now, with the Pantokrator departed, the Sun Father has returned along with his daughters to claim his birthright and ascend the Throne of Heaven. The Sun Father is skilled in all the magic of the skies, whilst his two daughters are skilled in the magic of the dawn and the night sky. His Daughters will lose some magical power whilst away from their Father, however he can call them to him in times of need with but a word.

Trinity God - Sun Father, Morning Star & Evening Star
Father has full paths & no penalty for separation, can call both Daughters
Morning Star has -2F, Full A, Evening Star has -2A, Full S, both get -1 paths when alone

#descr "In ancient times the Pantokrator appointed a single being to watch over the heavens, the earth and the Underworld. This being saw all that occurred, and reported to the Pantokrator each sin committed so that punishment could be assigned. Over time the being grew fond of the creatures over which it watched, and no longer wished to cause them pain and suffering. He took great golden bands and sealed them over his eyes, that he would not be able to see their sins. When the Pantokrator discovered such treachery he bound his servant below the earth for eternity. Now the shackles grow weaker and the Lord of Mysteries can return to the world he covets. He has three heads for watching the three realms, however the golden bands that block his sight cannot be removed. The priests of the Lord of Mysteries undergo a sacred ritual whereby they seal their eyes behind gold bands in imitation of their Lord. This grants them great power over the three realms, but with the expected side effect.

Starting item: Golden Bands (makes bearer blind)
Priests gain Gold Bands (makes bearer blind, grants +1A, +1E, +1D magic)

#descr "The Titan of the Night is a giant of divine heritage. She was born out of chaos in ancient times and claimed dominion over the night and darkness in all its forms. She gave birth to the Keres, the bloodthirsty daimones of the underworld, and rules them as their queen. In time even the Pantokrator grew fearful of her and bound her in a great cave at the entrance to Tartarus. With the Pantokrator gone it is rumoured she may have already broken her chains and stalks the world unseen. The Titan of the Night can become invisible at will, but sometimes appears as a gaunt winged figure robed in bloody garments. The Titan of the Night is more powerful in darkness and her touch can drain the life from the living. As her Dominion grows strong her children will arrive to serve her, and one such being will always appear to herald her appearance and guide her followers. Her goal is to plunge the entire world into eternal night, and should this be achieved her children will be set free in great numbers.

Starting Commander: 1 Ker
Ker commanders gain H1
Dominion will cause Ker to appear during Eternal Twilight (5% x candles chance per province) or Utterdark (10% x candles chance per province)
May summon a Ker commander each month (Candles x 5% chance)

Now, with the Pantokrator gone it has emerged to claim the Throne of Heaven and rule over the entire world. The monstrous creature has inherited the foul temper of his father and is prone to go berserk if anyone opposes him. He can summon great Jotun wolves by howling at the moon, and in battle will call nearby wolves to the fight.

Casts Howl in battles
May call 3 Jotun Wolves each month
May summon a Jotun Werewolf commander each month (candles x 5% chance)

#descr "The Founding Father was a sagacious king in ancient times and one of the legendary founding fathers of the empire. He warred with the Jade Emperor and commanded 81 tribes before the unification of the empire and the coming of peace. The Founding Father is incredibly fierce in combat and will inspire his men to great deeds. His head is that of a brass bull, and his four arms always carry weapons of war. With the Pantokrator gone his advisors have convinced him to don the yoke of Godhood and seek the power to rule over all as the Pantokrator. As his Dominion grows strong soldiers descended from the 81 tribes will gather to serve him, and at his forts where Order is strong bureaucrats will appear to administer his growing empire.

The monster could sleep for centuries, but when it awoke earthquakes and tidal waves threatened the creation of the previous Pantokrator. The Pantokrator sent his generals into the depths to slay the monster but the Dagon devoured them all. The Pantokrator commissioned his foremost craftsman to forge a net from the intestines of seven primordial monsters. The marshal of the Celestial Host was given authority to use the net and the Word of the Pantokrator and The Dagon was finally defeated and imprisoned for millennia. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the prison is failing and the Dagon is stirring, earthquakes and tidal waves herald his awakening. Word has spread amongst the Deep Ones and now fanatics congregate at his temples to await his return. These fervent warriors are revered and will join his armies at no cost. As the Dagon spreads his Dominion across the seas the Deep Ones will re-emerge and will spread across the world to enact his holy will.

She gave birth to serpent-kin, monsters and giants until the previous Pantokrator rose to power. When he established the new order he banished or slew all that threatened his creation, and the Mother of Monsters and her offspring were imprisoned for eternity. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, her shackles are weakening and her offspring once more threaten to destroy the world. As the mother of serpent-kin, she is sacred to lamias and will receive three additional lamias with each summoning. In addition, priests preaching at a temple may attract a Lamia to serve the Mother. Each month she will give birth to strange and misshapen beings and can create more should she so desire.

It is through these that the Demilich can still affect this world. Should the skull be destroyed, a new one will form shortly after and the Demilich will be able to affect the world again. Being so powerful, there is nothing left to acquire but godhood. The Demilich is very magically powerful and difficult to destroy, but lacking a body he is unable to move between provinces through means other than magic rituals. The Demilich resides in a trap-filled crypt in the capital, into which heroes can venture to search for treasure and glory. It is a powerful necromancer will animate the dead each turn to serve it, including corpses in the province if any are present. The prophet of the Demilich will be granted great knowledge of death and necromancy. The skulls of ancient prophets of the Demilich retain their knowledge of undeath and will sometimes be gifted to its followers.

The Nataraja is armed with four weapons and has the martial prowess to wield them simultaneously. He is the Divine Dancer, and can summon servants from the celestial realm to join his endless dance of creation. The Nataraja is surrounded by an aura of celestial fire, heavenly music and divine splendour. This will burn and cow attackers, whilst the music will spur celestial dancers to perform a battle dance, acting twice as often per round. The Nataraja is the lord of the heavenly dancers and they will appear to serve him as his Dominion grows strong. Each month he can summon celestial dancers and warrior-musicians from the heavenly realm.

When the war ended the Pantokrator banished the remaining Aesir from the world. With the Pantokrator gone the Allfather has returned to the world to claim it as his. The Allfather was the foremost of the Aesir and is a master of magic, a great skald and an outstanding general. Like his subjects, he is a master of illusions and false appearances and is able to pass undetected with a whole army through enemy lands. Like his servants the Vanjarls of Vanheim, the Allfather is able to cross the oceans by ship, and Vanjarls will appear to serve him as his Dominion grows strong. The Allfather is at all times accompanied by two great wolves, his raven and his great eight-legged horse who is able to ride the winds.

She was eternally imprisoned for her impudence of giving the Pantokrator a headache. Her origin as a thought has made her wise and prudent. Her shield is painted with a Gorgoneion that strikes fear into the hearts of men. She is at all times followed by her owl companion. She is the patron and protectress of the amazons, and within her Dominion her armies lead by amazon queens will be bolstered by amazons once they reach the size of a mighty host. Once her host swells to over five hundred troops she will send an avatar to lead them to victory.

Starting commanders: 2 x Amazon Queens
Armies containing around 100 troops within Dominion lead by an Amazon Queen will gain 4d6 amazons/month
At end of each year Amazon Priestesses (Crystal, Jade, Onyx & Garnet) along with an Amazon Queen and 8-24 sacred Amazon units will appear at the capital

As Lord of the Heavens he could see everything underneath and would punish sinners with thunder and storms. When he gazed upon the world below, he became aware of the beauty of women and could not help himself. He broke his master's decree, entered the world of men and begot offspring infused with his divine seed. The Pantokrator was furious and imprisoned the rebellious titan for eternity. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, lightning and thunder is wrecking the foundations of the prison and the Titan will soon claim the world as his to rule. The Titan of Heaven will call forth a great lightning storm when battle is joined to devastate his enemies. His blessing will always protect the faithful from lightning in addition to any other effects chosen.

At temples dedicated to the Jade Emperor celestial servants will descend to serve their master as his Dominion grows strong.

If Awake, capital population will swell by around 5,000 people
Non-capital forts within Dominion will gain around 100 population per month
Temples may summon a Celestial Servant (10% x candles chance)
Fort temples may summon Celestial Servant commander (1% x candles chance, S1H1 50%E)

Afraid of his destructive powers, men began to worship him as though he was a God. The Pantokrator was furious and banished his servant for eternity. Now that the Pantokrator is gone, the Earth Shaker is once more free to shatter cities and receive the prayers of men. He will grant his followers three magical gifts that will allow travel to the other realm. The waters serve him and he once took Thalassa as his consort. Whilst underwater Hippocampi will flock to serve him as his Dominion grows strong. The Titan of the Sea can leave the ocean and grant an entire army the ability to breathe underwater. During battle or when besieging a fortress he will cause an earthquake that will cause great damage. He is served by the Undines which will arrive below the waves as his Dominion grows strong.

During the aeons the Titan learned his craft and became a true master when it comes to forging magic items and mundane tools. Now his skills will serve both the farmers and savants of his kingdom. When forging magic items, he requires fewer magic gems than an ordinary mage. Before a battle he will temper the armor of all his followers, granting it increased protection (+3 Prot). The Forge Lord has had a deformed foot since his days in the service of the Pantokrator. He is served by the Brothers of the Forge, a dedicated band of gigantic warriors that wear arms and armor specially forged by the Titan. It is his goal to reconstruct the Forge of the Ancients, and should he achieve this he will use it to create many great wonders. The Titan is skilled at the forging of magical items, however his magical knowledge is limited and he will be unable to cast the most powerful rituals his skills would suggest.

#descr "The Drakaina was once a Titaness, beautiful beyond belief. When she spurned the previous Pantokrator she was cursed with a hideous form and was imprisoned on an enchanted isle. She now appears as a woman with the lower part of a huge serpent. From the serpent grow six dogs that hunger for human flesh. For millennia the baying of the dogs have frightened sailors that mistakenly have come too close to her island prison. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, her shackles are weakening and the Drakaina will avenge her millennial imprisonment. The curse that affects her will be visited upon any that incur her anger, however her priests have found ways to mitigate the curse so that hardships of all kinds are lessened.

#descr "The Old Man of the Sea is possibly the oldest of all the underwater beings born at the dawn of time, when the sea was untamed and filled with monstrous beings. Wise beyond compare he was given power to guide the new-born races of the deeps by a previous Pantokrator. But regardless of his wishes, the tritons begun to worship him as though he was a god. When the Old Man of the Sea mentioned this to the Pantokrator, his master grew jealous and banished his servant for eternity, leaving the races of the deeps bereft of magical guidance. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the Old Man of the Sea is returning to bring wisdom and magic understanding to the races of the deeps. His followers will erect temples dedicated to the study of the sea, attracting many wise beings hoping to learn its secrets. The Old Man of the Sea is able to leave the ocean and can bring an entire army of land-living beings with him below the waves.

Casts Rituals as if 1 path level higher in all paths

The Lord of the Waves was given power over all shallow waters and the waves, where the sea meets the winds, by a previous Pantokrator. But hubris found him and he sired the tritons and let them worship him as though he was a god. The Pantokrator was furious and banished his rebellious servant for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the Lord of the Waves is once more free to receive the prayers of triton and men alike. The Lord of the Waves is able to leave the sea and can bring land-living beings with him to the sunken realm. Whilst below the waves he will be guarded by four sacred knights at all times. He is attended at all times by servants from the sea and more will arrive as his Dominion grows strong. Whilst below the waves he can command the sea and will be able to raise great fortresses of kelp to protect his servants.

Now that the Pantokrator is gone, the Keeper has seen his chance to become the new God. When defending a castle he will make it almost impregnable. When battle commences he will blow his Gjallarhorn that can stun enemies when blown with great fervour, and each month Vanir warriors will arrive to serve the bearer of the horn. Forts within the Dominion of the Keeper will see warriors appear to aid in their defence, whilst the Thrones of Ascension will be protected by replicas of the Pantokrators Citadel of Power.

+500 Castle Defence
Summons Vanir Huskarls up to Dominion candles each month
Forted provinces in Dominion gain 2 Province Defence per month (Max 50)
Captured unforted Thrones in friendly dominion will automatically gain a Citadel of Power

With the Pantokrator gone, he has foreseen that he will become the lord of this world. The Annunaki will foresee and prevent most bad events in the province where he dwells, and in battle will foresee the first damaging blow to strike each soldier and avert it. The Annunaki is served by a faithful Yazad that watches over the realm below the moon and will appear to aid his followers. This Yazad will have Dominion over either the Stars or the Sky and will have great magical power. Should the Annunaki claim a Throne of Ascension, he will perform a great ritual under the full moon. Worshippers will flock from miles around, including many devoted to the secrets held by the moon.

In battles casts Will of the Fates (Twist Fate all friendly troops)
Prevents 95% of bad events in local province
Starting Commander: Yazad of the Stars or Yazad of the Sky (50% chance of either, gain H3)
When Annunaki of the Moon is at a Throne, will create 10-50 gems (A,S,D), 1 Elludian Moon Mage, 2 Wizards of the Crescent Moon & 3 Werewolf commanders once each year

With the deception of the Teteo Inan and her plot against the Pantokrator, the Pantokrator answered by impregnating the Mother of Gods with a ball of feathers. When she gave birth, the Teotl was born fully aware and armed with a serpent stolen from his mother's womb. He was given power and rage by the Pantokrator and promptly slew his older siblings. With the rebellion quelled, the Pantokrator placed him in charge of the Armies of the Western Sun. He became the Warrior Supreme who crushed and devoured the enemies of the world in the name of his master. When the Pantokrator claimed the world and rewrote the Tablets of Destiny, he no longer needed the Warrior Supreme. Imprisoned for eternity, the Teotl raged against his prison, but not until the Pantokrator disappeared and his divine decree ended could he break loose. Now the Teotl of War has come to claim a world rightfully his. The Teotl is war-painted and wears a black war-mask over his face. He is armed with the Serpent he was born with and uses it as an enchanted club that will poison his enemies with its venomous fangs. In combat he will move with incredible speed and can manifest gems of Fire and Nature for use in spellcasting. As the Warrior Supreme he is eager to prove his mettle against the false Gods and each year will hold an Arena to determine the strongest. When he competes in the arena warriors and worshipers will be drawn from miles around.

During day he would care for the dead and during night he would stalk the sick and the dying. Prowling the dark, he observed the night skies and saw the stars. Awestruck and envious, he opened his mouth and devoured them all. The Pantokrator was furious and banished him to the Underworld and stripped him of all flesh so that he could not return. Then he remade the night sky and set a Beast of the Night to hunt those who would covet the stars. With the disappearance of the Pantokrator, the Laws of Death were broken and now the Teotl can return to once more eat the stars. The Teotl of the Underworld wears a necklace of human eyeballs that shine with the light of the stars. The necklace gives him the ability to see everything that has passed and everything that will come to pass. Even the stars at night refuse to shine on the Teotl, and in battle he will shroud the conflict in total darkness that will render even torches useless. His priests will have great power over the dead, able to command them and even grant them power through prayers to the Teotl.

#descr "When the first drops of water made the earth hollow, the Roots of the Earth formed into a womb of stone and black water. The primordial water of Apsu caressed the under-earth and a giant woman formed in the Womb of the Earth. Given life and purpose by the Pantokrator, she was charged with caring for the under-earth. But she fell in love with the subterranean lifeforms and was seduced by the eldest Olm and gave birth to strange amphibian humanoids with external gills and cyclops eyes. At first the Pantokrator tolerated her misstep, and she helped him form the Seal that must not be Broken. But the making of the Seal demanded a huge sacrifice of her progeny, and she demanded compensation for her kin. Angry with her impudence he imprisoned her for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone her prison is weakening, but so is the Seal. Once returned to the world her love, the Eldest Olm, will seek her out and join her once more. The Earth Made Flesh cares deeply for the under-earth and is the protector of the Earth Blood. Should she create an Earth Blood Well Pale Ones will flock from the deepest reaches of the earth to aid her, however should another Pretender try to burrow into her realm, she will stymie the flow of Blood, siphoning off the gems gained.

Cave provinces generate approx +5% income per candle
Eldest Olm may appear once Earth Made Flesh awakens (20% chance per month, W3E3, can summon Shard Guard)
If Earth Blood Deep Well cast by another Pretender, enchantment produces 2D6 less E gems/month
If Earth Made Flesh controls Earth Blood Deep well, gains 3-18 Pale One Soldiers and 6-16 Ancient Wet Ones each month enchantment remains

For eternities he lurked under the surface of those still waters, occasionally surfacing to spy on the ruler of all, learning forbidden names and the secrets of the divine. When he realized the Pantokrator had disappeared he decided to usurp the place of his master using the secrets he had gleaned during his patient wait. Used to feed on the flesh of those that displeased his master he has developed a hunger for the flesh of men, especially the clergy of other would be gods. The flesh he consumes will increase his hit points each month.

He was given the splendor of the sun, the rage of the storm and the life-bringing rain as tools and was commanded to bring civilization and order to creation. But the splendor of the sun gave the Viracocha hubris and he tried to create men to inhabit the world. He breathed air into stones and created a race of giants. But the stone giants were imbecilic and violent and they threatened other races created by the Pantokrator. The Pantokrator was displeased and took the rain from his servant and drowned the giants with a great flood. The Viracocha was imprisoned for eternity. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the Viracocha can return and bring splendor to the world and claim it as his. The blessing of the Viraocha will always grant protection from the beating sun and the raging storm in addition to other blessings chosen. He still recalls his stone children and will breathe life into a field of stones to create an army to serve him. Each month the Viracocha can breathe air into more stone statues to bring them to a semblance of life.

#descr "The Apu Inti, Lord Sun, is a giant of divine heritage. When his father sinned against the Pantokrator the Apu Inti inherited the splendor of the sun in his father's stead. He was given dominion over the Sun and everything upon which it shone. But the Inti became enamored with the beings underneath the sun and the Huacas of the land. He sired the Ayar brothers, divine heroes unchecked by the Pantokrator. The Lord of the world found the Inti's insolence even worse than his father's, and the Lord Sun and his siblings were imprisoned in caves with unbreakable doors of Garnet and Gold. But now, with the Pantokrator gone, the doors of Garnet and Gold are weakening and they shudder with each strike of the imprisoned Sun. When they finally shatter, the Apu Inti will reclaim a world once his. Whilst the Apu Inti is in the world the Sun Kings and the Priestesses of the Sun will gain the power of the sun, becoming more powerful in Fire magic. Before battle he will manifest the splendour of the sun into three fire gems, to fuel more powerful spellcasting.

#selectmonster 2755 -- Hun Came
#descr "The Hun Came, One Death, is a giant of divine heritage once placed in charge of the beginning of the cycle of death by a previous Pantokrator. He would cause death and lamentation to the world. He saw that everything in the world would come under his reign sooner or later, but this was not entirely true. Dominion over the cycle of death was shared with his brother Vucub Came, Seven Death. He was given the end of the cycle by the Pantokrator. Hun Came came to realize that his brother represented the end of Hun Came's authority and he became jealous. The One Death shared his powers with nine lieutenants, the Bolon-ti-ku, the Nine-Gods, and with their aid he slew his brother and ended the cycle of death and rebirth. With the breach of the natural order set up by the Pantokrator the world became depopulated, wild and inhospitable. The world was plunged into darkness and the dead threatened to replace the living. The Pantokrator became furious and punished his rebellious servant with eternal imprisonment. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the prison of the Hun Came is weakening and the world might once more be plunged in Darkness. In battle he will conjure death gems to aid in more powerful spellcasting. Within lands controlled by the Hun Came Death scales will cause the dead to animate to serve the Lord of Death. This effect will increase as his Dominion grows stronger and more undead will animate where temples or forts are present.

Death limit increased by +2
Dominion spawns longdead & soulless in Death scales. Higher Death scales and Dominion gives more summons, forts and temples generate additional undead
Temples in Death 3 scales may spawn Bolon-ti-ku (1% x candles chance)

He is the progenitor of the monsters of the sea and he claimed dominion over the dangers of the deep.

She was given authority and power over the winds and the waves by a previous Pantokrator, but she fell in love with mankind and taught them the secrets of sailing, ship crafting and trade. When the Pantokrator heard the prayers of sailors and tradesmen he realized that she had betrayed his trust and he punished her with eternal imprisonment. The Titan of Winds and Waves can bring men across the sea as well as into the sea. In battles the wind and water will obey her command, guiding her followers arrows and manifesting to aid her.

#cleararmor
#descr "The Son of the Sea is an ancient demigod sprung from the Sea. Once the servant of the previous Pantokrator he became the psychopomp of the watery dead. He would take the newly dead on his boat 'Wave Sweeper' to the Land of the Watery Dead, where they would live on in the gloomy halls underneath the stormy seas. When the Fomorians rebelled against the Pantokrator and ravaged the world, the Son of the Sea was punished for having given them the means to escape their prison land. The Son of the Sea was imprisoned for millennia, but with the Pantokrator gone, his shackles are weakening and he is ready to enter the world of the living as God and ruler of all. The Son of the Sea is strongly attuned to the sea and the storms, but his task of guiding the souls of the dead has given him great powers over the dead. He is a master of trickery and illusions and can hide his true appearance. With his ship, 'Wave Sweeper', he can bring his followers across the sea, or he can bless them with water-breathing. Each month he can call those killed at sea from the Land of the Watery Dead to serve him, and the souls of those he kills may be forced to serve him in the afterlife. Whilst searching below the waves for hidden sites he may come across abandoned Fomorian castles that can be reclaimed by his followers.

Summons Drowned Dead up to candles each month
Raises killed enemies as Drowned Ghosts

After giving his daughter the mandate of the sun and his first son the mandate of the moon, the Pantokrator no longer felt obliged to grant a celestial mandate to his snot-born child. Instead he gave it the mandate of the storms and the sea. Infuriated the third child of the Pantokrator rebelled and caused destruction and disorder wherever he went.

He taught mankind how to grow and harvest crops, make wine and brew beer, and care for cattle of all kinds. So great were his gifts to mankind that men lost faith in their true God, the Pantokrator. Furious the Pantokrator gave his servant wine and beer to drink, and the Duiu drank and fell asleep, a sleep from which he would never awake. But now, with the Pantokrator gone, his drunken stupor has lost its enchantment and the Duiu of Farming is slowly waking up. The Duiu of Farming wields a great hammer and carries a bowl that produces gems of nature. Within the Dominion of the Duiu fertile lands with growth scales may begin to bear enchanted fruit in the spring, which can be collected as magical nature gems.

Eager to consummate his mandate the Duiu of War brought strife and turmoil to mankind. Alliances were broken and families divided, tribes were slaughtered and villages burned to the ground. The prayers of mankind took a different tone and the Pantokrator listened and watched. He witnessed a war torn land where mankind no longer prayed to him, but to the destroying god of war and strife. Furious the Pantokrator shackled the Duiu of War on a slab of stone with bonds of lightning, planted an oak atop the shackled Duiu and told the oak to grow for eternity. But now, with the Pantokrator gone, the oak is dying and the power of thunder has been claimed by an unknown entity. Soon the oak will have rotted away and mankind will once more slay their kin. The Duiu is aided by fierce warriors that will flock to his banner as his Dominion grows strong, and the ranks of his followers will swell with barbarians.

For some reason the spring was special to the Pantokrator and he instilled his power in the sparkling waters. He told the Matrona never to bathe in the sacred waters and to keep them ever clean. But the Matrona of the Spring couldn't resist and bathed in the blessed waters, and the powers instilled in the spring were suffused in her body. And mankind came to her and begged her to heal them from all ills, and they gave her their prayers. But one day the Pantokrator returned to take his centennial bath, and discovered that the reinvigorating powers of the spring was lost and its waters befouled by the filth of men. Furious he threw the Matrona into the spring and placed a cliff on top of it imprisoning her for eternity. But now, with the Pantokrator gone, a trickle of water is eroding the stone. Soon the Matrona of the Healing Spring will once more bring mercy and wisdom to mankind. Temples dedicated to the Matrona may cause local springs to develop healing powers as her Dominion grows strong.

His demonic servants guided the dead to their next life. But with time his mind darkened, and he was seduced by jealousy and hunger for power. He demanded prayers from men in return for a good afterlife. His judgment lost righteousness and his servant demons wrongfully led the newly dead to the hellish realm of the Dharmapala. When the Pantokrator realized that his most trusted servant had broken the laws of death and rebirth to collect the prayers of men he was furious and imprisoned the Dharmapala in this world, disconnected from the Hell he had created. Now with the Pantokrator gone the Dharmapala is free to once more judge the dead as he sees fit. He is able to summon Demons from Hell to serve him, and demonic jailers can be summoned from an entrance to Hell in the capital.

Furious the Lord of All punished men with awareness of their inevitable downfall, but the Titan of Forethought robbed them of foresight and hope returned to mankind. Finally the Pantokrator shackled his servant to a rock and sent a great vulture to daily feed on the liver of his former servant. Now with the disappearance of the Pantokrator the Titan of Forethought has returned to thwart those who claim Dominion over this world. He will teach his followers the ways of the fire and the heavens, and whilst at a fort will teach his skills to the local populace if Growth, Luck, Productivity or Order scales are present.

#descr "The Titan of the Hunt is a giant of divine heritage born at the dawn of time times. She became a huntress of primordial beasts and was entrusted by a previous Pantokrator to care for the wilderness. He gave her a golden bow and authority over the animals of the wild. But mankind began to make offerings to the Huntress and she let herself be worshiped and promised mankind that she would protect the huntsmen and the unmarried women of the world. The Pantokrator sent his servants to punish her for her breach of trust, but she transformed herself into a deer and escaped into the First Forest. Here she met another of the Pantokrator's servants and he gave her hounds to aid her in the Hunt. The Pantokrator was furious and trapped them both in the forest for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone the paths of the First Forest are once more open and the Titan of the Hunt can once more hear the prayers of young women and huntsmen. With primordial monsters emerging anew the Titan of the Hunt has taken it upon herself to rid the world of monsters and claim the world as hers. The Titan of the Hunt is always accompanied by her sacred hounds, as well as animals of the wild, and more will appear as her Dominion grows strong. Women praying at her temples may receive a divine visitation as her Dominion grows strong.

#descr "The Titan of the Spring is a giant of divine heritage born in primordial times. When her Father rose to power he gave her authority over all things growing. But the Great Adversary became enamored with her and abducted her to the Underworld. The Pantokrator had placed a Veil between the worlds to prevent the plots of his Adversary, but his daughter was lost beyond the Veil and the world slowly withered and died. Only with the aid of the Queen of Crossroads who was able to venture beyond the Veil was the whereabouts of the Titan of Spring found. The Pantokrator was the ruler of this world and his powers were diminished in the Underworld. With guile and subtle threats he confronted the Lord of the Underworld and Spring was allowed to return to the world of the living, and all rejoiced. But mankind fell in love with The Spring and began to worship her as a God. Her Father was furious and sent her back to the Underworld. Now with the Pantokrator gone, his daughter can once more cross the Veil and return to this world, worshiped as bringer of growth and benefactor of the dead. The Titan of the Spring is reborn every Spring and during the spring she will cause living things to bloom, increasing growth scales and tax income. Each winter she journeys to the underworld once more, however her followers will receive gems and servants from the Underworld as compensation for their absent mistress. Lamentations of her subjects cannot sway the Lord of the Underworld, but she is allowed to return to the living spring come.

During spring local province gains Growth scales, 25% taxboost & 1-6 nature gems
In Winter if Titan of Spring is alive she dies, receives 4-24 D gems & 17-80 longdead, shades, wights, ancestral spirits & Mound King Commander (D2H1), may receive 2 Ker commanders (50% chance) or a Mound Fiend (25% chance)

When men encountered the Sacred Mountain they were led by a serpent to its summit. Here they were approached by the Ilah and they began to worship him as a God. The Pantokrator was furious and imprisoned the Ilah for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the Ilah will return to rule the world from the mountain at the center of All. The Sacred Mountain is located in the capital and each month the high priest will undertake a pilgrimage to its golden peak, guided by the serpent. There they will be granted fire gems and great cartloads of finely crafted weapons and armour to aid the faithful. The Mountain is home to a legendary band of holy warriors bearing jinn-forged weapons of smokeless flame.

#descr "The Great Archon is a divine being sprung from the Eighth Sphere, beyond the Seven Heavens. Curious of mankind it manifested itself on the Earth, but Earth was under the dominion of a Demiurge who called himself Pantokrator. The Great Archon tried to guard mankind from ignorance with a Shield of Wisdom, and he taught men how to overcome the restrictions placed on matter and mind by the Demiurge. But the might of the Demiurge was great in his own domain and he discovered the manifestation of the Great Archon and trapped and bound it with shackles of ignorance. For ages the Great Archon wandered the earth as a monster bereft of purpose, suffering from the same condition from which it had tried to save mankind. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the shackles are weakening and the Great Archon can once more protect men from ignorance and lead them to insight.

When the previous Pantokrator allowed mankind to replace the Jinnun and demanded that the Firstborn and his servants bow to man, he rebelled. He, a being of pure flame, would never bow to creatures of dirt and mud. And so he led the Jinnun in war against humanity. The Pantokrator was furious, cursed him and imprisoned him in the Desert of Red, White and Black Sands for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the Firstborn of the Smokeless Flame can once more wage war upon men and restore the Jinnun to their former might. His spirit is strong and all creatures of the magical realm will feel his blessing when he is near, however this will not affect the mud creatures of the mortal realm.

#descr "The Zmey Gorynch is an ancient weather spirit of great power. Born as a simple snake, the creature began to grow and by 100 years of age was as large as a man. It then underwent a marvelous change, sprouting wings and gaining a roar like thunder. It can take the form of a handsome young man astride a magnificent white horse which it uses to seduce and beguile the weak willed. Over the years many would-be heroes have come to slay the beast, however it has bested them all. The physical body of the creature is not well suited for spell casting and its skills will be reduced when casting spells from paths other than Air. Therefore, the Zmey will tend to adopt human form for spellcasting, but when wounded will revert to its true form. The Zmey has a great hoard accumulated over years that will swell the coffers of the treasury. As a weather spirit, as it claims the Thrones of Ascension it will gain great power over storms and summon many storm spirits.

Starting treasury gains 500 gold
-2 to non-air paths unless in Human form
May summon 1 lesser Zmey each month
When Zmey Gorynch is at a Throne will gain 5-30 Air gems, 2 Sylph commanders, 1 Size 9 Air Elemental commander, 5-15 Sylphs & 3-10 size 9 Air Elementals once each year

She pledged her service as a messenger of death in return for the powers of flight and magical longevity. Over the centuries the power of her patron waned and they are now long gone. However, the First Valkyrie remains and some say she has Aesir blood in her veins. She has since decided to lead her people and assume the mantle of a Pretender God to claim the Throne of Heaven. The First Valkyrie is protected by a Divine aura and few would dare to strike at her. She bears enchanted arms forged in Vanhalla and like all vanir can cloak her appearance in illusion, along with any army that accompanies her. She has survived the fiercest storms and now she can even outrun the lightning. The priesthood of the Valkyrie will be granted the power of flight whilst they are under her blessing, and will be as quick as the lightning itself.

It has keen eyesight and can fly through the fiercest coastal storms. When the previous Pantokrator rose to power he imprisoned and banished all that threatened his power and the Gull was forever imprisoned. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, it is breaking free and its shrill cry can once more be heard around the world. The Great Gull can soar over the ocean to distant lands and its screeches bring fear to the hearts of men. It is always accompanied by a flock of sacred Albatross, great seabirds that follow in its wake and can fly in any storm, and more will appear at coastal temples to serve its priests. To kill an albatross brings bad luck and most sailors will avoid causing them any harm.

Casts Storm in battles
Coastal temples may summon 1D3 sacred Albatross each month (Candles x 10% chance)
Prophet gains +1W per month (Max W4)

It will call forth hurricanes to smite the followers of false Pretenders as its Dominion grows strong.

In the great battle between Gods the crab nipped the Pantokrator on the toe to distract him. Enraged, the Pantokrator imprisoned and banished those that had defied him and the Island Crab was imprisoned for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the shackles are weakening and the waves of the stirring crab can once more be felt across the oceans of the world. The Island Crab is immensely well protected by the great shell it bears. The Crab is slow, however any lesser beings that stand against it will be crushed underfoot. Crabs of all kinds congregate at its temples and as its Dominion grows strong larger crabs will appear that can snip off a mans arm. Heikegani, Crab warriors said to be the reborn spirits of great warriors, serve it as sacred warriors.

UW & coastal temples may spawn 1 Cave Crab (Candles x 10% chance) or Heikegani (Candles x 5% chance)
Capital gains Temple of the Crab providing sacred Heikegani recruits

When the previous Pantokrator ascended he banished the creatures of darkness and the Night Hunter was imprisoned for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the shackles are weakening and the smell of fresh blood awakens ancient desires in the creature once more. The Night Hunter can detect the scent of those suitable for blood magic. It can see in the purest darkness and can drain the life blood of the living. Bats will flock from their caves to follow the Night Hunter, and as its Dominion grows strong fiendish Beast Bats sacred to his followers will join the flock. Priests of the Hunter will always have some skill in the magic of blood, whilst the blessing of the Night Hunter will always grant perfect night vision to its followers. When the Hunter roams the night in search of victims, terror falls upon the land and none dare speak against it.

Summons Beast Bats up to Dominion candles each month
H2 or more Priests will gain B1 upon recruitment if no Blood magic
Bless always gains perfect Darkvision

Now, with the Pantrokator gone, the shackles are weakening and the Stag can once more inspire men to hunt. As its Dominion grows strong the barrier between this world and the next will grow thin, and mischievous fey will appear to aid its followers. The Stag is a fey creature and can cloak its appearance in illusion and trickery. Temples of the stag erected in the heart of a fortress will include a portal to the fey realm, and rarely one of the Fair Folk will appear from the Land of the Ever Young.

Other figures were to be seen with the legs and horns of goats, while yet others united the hind quarters of a horse with the body of a man. Finally came hulking creatures with the bodies of men but with the heads and tails of great sharks.
Eventually Tiamat was cut asunder and her children scattered to the four corners of the earth. Now they reside in dark places from whence they can only be drawn with powerful magic.

It once slept beneath a great lake by an ancient city and was worshiped by the strange beings that dwelled on the shore. When the humans of the city cruelly slaughtered the beings, the Water Lizard stirred. On the anniversary of the slaughter, the Water Lizard rose up and utterly destroyed the city, so completely that not even ruins remained. Fearful of its power the Pantokrator banished the creature back below the waves, never to return. Now with the Pantokrator gone it stirs once more and will rise to conquer the land by donning the mantle of God itself. The Lizard is served by strange fish-frogs that will arrive to serve its followers, and more will congregate at strange temples along the coasts as its Dominion grows strong. In a siege it can tear down walls at a tremendous rate and is worth a hundred normal soldiers.

#descr "The Piscean is a monstrous fish born at the dawn of time, when monsters and giants roamed the world. It has terrorised coastal civilizations and preyed upon the undersea kingdoms of the first Tritons. When the previous Pantokrator rose to power he imprisoned and banished all that threatened his creation and the Piscean was imprisoned for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the shackles are weakening and the great fish begins to stir once more. The Piscean is a monstrous creature that will strike terror in those who oppose it and is surrounded by shoals of lesser fish that feed upon the morsels it leaves. The worshipers of the Piscean will find their nets are always full and the bounty of the sea comes easily to them. This will increase tax income within its income in forted provinces below the waves and at coastal provinces on land. As the great fish sheds scales these will be collected by its followers to create suits of armor and to fashion into talismans.

Summons Fish & Large fish up to twice Dominion candles
UW Forts and Coastal land provinces may generate 20% more income (Candles x 10% chance)
UW province with Piscean present generates 30% more tax
Each month may create a Fish Scale Armor (5% chance per candle, Casts Liquid Body) or an Amulet of the Fish (3% chance per candle, allows Air Breathing)

This embryonic Void being of great power appeared through the Void Gate and is worshiped by the starspawn of R'lyeh. The Larva does not communicate in any comprehensible way, but its priests divine its will through arcane rituals. Incredibly powerful and attuned to the world of magic, it will warp the minds of nearby creatures that are not protected from the Void and cause many to act erratically in its presence. Void affected troops may attack friends aswell as foes, and their minds may be permanently damaged by the experience. The Larva moves partially through the void and in battle it will appear and disappear, acting seemingly at random.

Casts Mind Warp in battles (25% of units must resist with MR or suffer Confusion and +10 Insanity, mindless or those with Void Sanity are immune)
Casts 3 spells each combat round
Magic scale locked to 5
Moves around the battlefield randomly and may horror mark attackers

#descr "The Brazen Bull is a terrible statue of a bull cast in bronze and animated by a bloodthirsty spirit. A hatch allows sacrifices to be placed inside, where they will be burnt to a crisp by the roaring furnace that burns in the belly of the bull. The screams of the sacrifices are channeled to create the bellowing of the demon bull and smoke pours from its mouth and nose. Over centuries the bull has demanded ever greater sacrifices to sate its hunger. Countless offerings later and now with the Pantokrator gone, the Brazen Bull has the chance of putting the world under its strong dominion and becoming the True God. At temples dedicated to the Bull a brazen effigy will be created. Each month fifty of the local populace will be gathered. Most will be sacrificed and burned within it, creating Fire gems from the ashes, whilst a few of pure blood will be sent to the dungeons. These bulls are the site of frenzied rituals and there is a chance each month one will awaken to serve the True God.

Temples in forts gain Brazen Bull site (2F2B, kill 50 population each month)

It has a legendary fury and over time the warriors of the cold north began to worship the beast. The Pantokrator saw this and imprisoned the beast for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone the Spirit Bear is free to roam the frozen lands and swim the frozen seas once more. Hunters along the shore revere the beast and forts along the coast will always contain shrines to the creature. Should the seas freeze over then these hunters are skilled at finding magical ice crystals. The Bear tribe especially revere the Spirit Bear and will provide great tribute.

Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the shackles of the eternal prison are weakening and the Great Toad is preparing to return once more. The toad has thick leathery skin and its huge form renders weapons unable to pierce it mostly ineffectual.

The Tathagata of Void embodies the wisdom of emptiness and the avoidance of ignorance, and astral mages will flock to him to join his priesthood. In his presence wisdom and learning will blossom however the magical world will become empty as the void. Now with the Pantokrator gone he has realized the aspirations of the other Pretenders and will protect its subjects by donning the mantle of God itself. Each Tathagata is protected by a Wisdom King, a divine warrior that manifests when they are threatened with harm.

Bless gains +4MR once Awakens
Astral mages gain H1 if not already priests
Whilst at Nexus, will gain paths each month (Automatic +1 up to 5 in each path, then chance to gain path level each month)

The Void Essence is highly attuned to the minds of those who are asleep and can bring the wisdom of the stars to the dreams of entire nations. When the Void Essence is in an enemy territory, it will bring insanity to both enemy forces and the general population. It is protected by astral energies that will blast the minds of those that dare to strike at it and send nearby creatures into a restless dream-filled slumber. The Void Essence can open gates to the Void whilst at a temple in forts below the waves, and this will be easier as his Dominion grows strong.

Whilst present at a fort with a lab & temple, may open a Void Gate (Candles x 5% chance, can summon Void Beings)
Void Spectres will gain H2 upon summoning

To attract the attention of the Pantokrator and gain immortality he first stole from the Dragon King and then defied the Kings of Hell by wiping the names of all his subjects from the Book of Life and Death. When the Pantokrator heard of his antics he granted him the title 'Keeper of the Heavenly Horses' to mollify him and to keep a close eye on him, which pleased the Monkey King. He soon found however that he was in fact a lowly stable-boy and he became furious. He rebelled and led a group of lesser deities against the forces of Heaven, until he was captured and sealed below a mountain. Now, with the Pantokrator gone the Monkey King will soon escape to vie for control of the Throne of Heaven. He rides a magic cloud that bears him through the skies, and his strength is legendary. In battle he will summon magical duplicates by blowing on hairs he has plucked. The Monkey King is skilled in the magic of the wind, the water and the earth.

#descr "The Monkey King is a divine monkey spirit born from a magic stone. To attract the attention of the Pantokrator and gain immortality he first stole from the Dragon King and then defied the Kings of Hell by wiping the names of all his subjects from the Book of Life and Death. When the Pantokrator heard of his antics he granted him the title 'Keeper of the Heavenly Horses' to mollify him and to keep a close eye on him, which pleased the Monkey King. He soon found however that he was in fact a lowly stable-boy and he became furious. He rebelled and led a group of lesser deities against the forces of Heaven until he was captured and sealed below a mountain. Now, with the Pantokrator gone the Monkey King will soon escape to vie for control of the Throne of Heaven. He rides a magic cloud that bears him through the skies, and his strength is legendary. The Monkey King is skilled in the magic of the wind, the water and the earth."

#descr "The Divine Monkey was born long ago to his father, the God of Wind and an Apsara in the form of a Vanara. In his youth he was granted wishes by his father and ed to be unharmed by fire or water and to be as swift as the wind. After serving the Monkey King for many years he became known as a devout and loyal servant of the Pantokrator, serving as messenger for the One True God and aiding him against his enemies. After a particularly difficult battle the Pantokrator offered him a great reward, however the Monkey asked only for a place at his feet to worship him. Touched, the Pantokrator blessed his servant with immortality. One day however, the Pantokrator was gone and his gifts had waned. Bereft, the Divine Monkey has decided to don the yoke of Godhood and lead his people in the battle for Ascension. He is unharmed by flames, can survive under the water and is a competent general of the monkeyfolk. His physical and magical prowess are legendary and he has power over the air, the water and the land. Unless he is dormant or imprisoned he will arrive surrounded by an army of monkeyfolk and celestial beings dedicated to his cause. As his Dominion spreads White furred Vanara will emerge from the forest to serve him in great numbers.

Starting Army (if Awake): 4-8 Bandar, 8-30 White Ones, 3-9 Apsara & Gandharva commander
Summons White Ones up to Dominion candles each month
Forest provinces generate Atavi Archers (10% x candles chance for 2D6) and where a Temple is present White Ones may appear (10% x candles for 1D6)
Atavi provinces within Dominion gain a Fortified Village and Temple

The King will animate the dead as his Dominion grows strong, and at his temples where death is strong his priests will perform rituals to swell his undead army. The magic that animates the King also binds him to his Throne and he cannot leave it by any means. Now the King will don the mantle of a Pretender God to attain the title of Pantokrator and escape his imprisonment. Undead are worshiped as emissaries of the King and Undead commanders will be granted priestly powers at the great sepulchre in the capital.

Since the Melqarts left the earth and were trapped in Sheol, the Nephilim-worship transformed into ancestor-worship. As the deified dead became central to the cult of the Rephaim, some chose to extend their life indefinitely with the foul ritual of lichcraft. Having died and visited Sheol the Rephaite Lich Lord has returned from the realm of the Gods and now intends to rule over the realm of the living. Should the body of the Lich Lord be physically destroyed, a new one is formed from the dust of the dead. He will animate the dead to serve him once more, whilst Adons will be taught in the ways of Death to follow in the footsteps of their undying Lord.

#descr "Illithids are mentally powerful beings, able to paralyze enemies by sheer strength of mind. Long ago on a distant star they constructed a machine to manifest their very thoughts, making their wishes into reality. Unfortunately in their hubris the Star Spawn failed to account for the dark thoughts that reside in the subconscious mind. When the machine was switched on thoughts born of fear, rage and hatred took the form of invisible demons that stalked and slew their creators until they smashed the great machine that was their lifes work. Alas, the greatest of these creatures was already manifest, a monster born out of their arrogance. Out of fear the Star Spawns began to worship this being formed from their darkest emotions. When the star fell the Illithid hoped they had escaped their tormentor, however this hope was forlorn as the Id Monster has emerged once more. Now it eyes the Throne of Heaven to rule over the creatures of this new world. The Id Monster is naturally invisible but appears for brief moments when enraged. Those nearby feel hatred and fear more strongly, and unrest will increase in the province where it dwells.

The Seelie Empress is a beautiful butterfly-winged woman dressed in unimaginable splendour. She is always accompanied by swarms of sprites, small faeries with insect wings that love to play tricks on unsuspecting humans. Now she has emerged from the Dreamwild to enchant the mortals of this world and to bring the magic of her realm to this one. As the Dreamwild spreads, more of her subjects will emerge to serve her, including brave Fay Knights. Her mirror shows men their dreams realised, and many knights quest to receive just a glimpse of its wondrous visions. 

Starting item: Casts Lore of Legends on one target commander in province
Summons Fay Folk up to candles each month and can call Fay Knights
Unforted land provinces with temples where Dreamwild Demesne is active, become Seelie Path and will summon Fay each month and will heal commanders there (1 Knight + 1D3 Footfolk or, if forest, summon 1D6 Footfolk instead and 5% x candles chance for Fay Knight commander (G1N1H1))
& gain Sprite defenders; 1G mage can enter to summon Fay Knight

In the dreamwild the lands are divided between the seelie summer courts and the unseelie winter courts. The summer courts are known to be friendly and even give favors to their guests. The Winter courts, however, are cold, malicious and even hostile to mankind. From this frozen land the Unseelie Empress has emerged to trap the world in eternal frost. Now the winter courts extend their reach to this realm, and from Unseelie fortresses ride knights wreathed in illusion to conquer in the name of their Empress.

Forted thrones where Forgotten Palace or Immaculate Fort have been cast become Unseelie Forts
Unseelie forts can recruit Unseelie Soldiers, Knights and Mischief Makers (G2, 100%WAD) & gain Unseelie Sprite wall defenders
Empress may summon an Unseelie Prince commander each month (D1G2, 3% x candles chance)

Hungry for flesh and strong sake, it ravaged the world in ages past and cowed the primitive peoples of the world, demanding tribute. Eventually a child of the Pantokrator was sent to banish the ravenous creature. Laying out great barrels of sake, he waited for the creature to appear and drink itself into a stupor before cutting its heads and tail with his sword. However, as millenia have passed, the creature has grown back all of its heads and has returned to ravage the world once more. As it claims the Thrones of Heaven it will call its serpent-kin to serve it.

When Yamato no Orochi is at a Throne will gain 3D6 W gems, 3D6 N gems and 5-22 sacred serpents once each year

Being immortal, there is nothing left to acquire but godhood. The Master Lich is magically stronger than the other Liches and his magically empowered body is very hard to destroy. The priests of the Lich will perform rituals at his temples to reawaken the dead as his Dominion grows strong. In battle he will cause the dead to rise continuously. Ever more walking dead will emerge from the ground. Recently killed soldiers might reawaken and do battle against their former friends. This effect will only cease if the Master Lich is killed.

To prevent this evil mage from returning after his death, a long forgotten hero staked him in a bog.

A Dragons status and power is determined by the size of its hoard, which consists of all the unspent gold in the treasury.

Starts with Cursed Treasure Hoard that will curse other owners (assasinations, misfortune and curses) except the Ghost Dragon (can be cleansed with rising dominion power to 7)
Cursed hoard is hard to add to treasury, but it can be entered to gain some gold (25-75) with small risk of curses around capital province
Gold remaining in treasury triggers good events (1000 gold+ spawns ghosts, 2500 gold+ spawns magical gems & item)
Whilst Pretender in capital will attract adventurers (Adventurer assassins may attack, 250 gold+ can spawn items, 1500 gold+ gain Adventurer commander, 2000 gold+ spawns Gold & gems)

The Lich Queen lacks the Arch Mage's broad base of magical knowledge, but her reanimated body is more durable than a living body since it is leathery and dry and lacks all organs of importance. The Lich Queen once ruled over an ancient kingdom and will direct her servants to locate ancient burial grounds, using secrets buried in ancient texts. Mages researching may uncover these texts and animate ancient Dust Walkers to serve her once more. A text is more likely to be discovered where one of the researchers is skilled in Death magic, and even more likely if one is Undead.

At the end of each year, will perform Ritual of Undeath on a living priest in the province (max size 4, target gains +1D (or +2D if was no D) and becomes a Lich)
Additional lichcraft rituals can be performed upon a preaching priest in same province with Queen if 28 D gems are present in treasury (8d6 Death gems will be lost); 1 per month

As a being with great regenerative powers and a bringer of fertility it was worshiped by the first of men as a god of prosperity and healing. When the previous Pantokrator rose to power he imprisoned and banished all that threatened his power and the Rams-Headed Serpent was forever imprisoned in the forest of the Horned One where he found an ally with a temperament resembling his own. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the Rams-Headed Serpent is breaking free to claim the world as his. The blessing of the Serpent will always grant protection from most poisons in addition to any other blessing effects chosen. As the great Serpent sheds its skin, its followers will collect it and fashion armor that grants regeneration to the wearer.

The Black Bull is a creature of unbridled fury and a manifestation of the blind rage of Nature, the inhuman wildness, the glory of the slayer and the slain. Unlike his brother, the Great White Bull, with whom he has fought for dominance on several legendary occasions, the fertility aspect of the Black Bull is secondary to that of his maddened rage. Now that Ascension draws close, he leads his people to once again wildly embrace the mindless abandon and bloodlust of Nature aroused. At fortresses containing a temple of the Bull a great altar will be constructed where rites of the bloody wild will be enacted. As more rites are performed his followers will fight with wild abandon, ignoring mortal wounds. Any that fight alongside the Bull will feel the call of the wild in their veins and may go berserk.

#clearweapons
#descr "Born at the dawn of time the Demon Macaw represents an earlier era, when monsters and giants roamed the world. Gifted with brilliant splendor the monstrous bird became envious of the Sun and the Moon and chased them away from the skies. With the Sun and the Moon gone he impersonated the stellar entities himself and basked in the worship of mankind. Furious with the breach of his intended order the Pantokrator imprisoned the Demon Macaw for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the monster bird is breaking free from his prison and is once more worshiped as the Sun and the Moon. The Macaw can release a burst of light from his many-coloured wings that will blind & harm weaker beings. He knows the path to the Cavern of the Sun where the Sun and Moon travel at night and is served by the Zotz that reside there. His blessing will always grant some protection from flames and lightning regardless of other blessings chosen. The Macaw will impersonate the sun and any province he inhabits will always count as if it is in the presence of the sun. Battles where the Demon Macaw is present will be extremely bright and darkness will be banished.

When Awakens creates Cavern of the Sun in capital (3F1E, Recruitable Ah K'in Kan Ek & Sun Guard)
EA Xibalba only: Ah K'in Kan Ek gain F3 & H3 when recruited

#selectmonster 2783 -- Drakon
#descr "The Drakones are ancient many-headed reptiles of tremendous power. Born outside of this world, the Drakones were once summoned and used by a previous Pantokrator as punishment when he found his servants lacking in faith. The Drakones brought destruction upon nations and soon the very world was at risk. The Pantokrator decided to imprison the Drakones for millennia. Now with the Pantokrator gone, their shackles are weakening. Drakones are enormous, scaly beasts capable of breathing poisonous gas upon enemies. Some Arcoscephalean historians claim that they are progenitors or a primitive form of the great dragons. Drakones are wingless and do not have the ability to change shape. As the Drakon ravages the countryside it will grow strong, and its Dominion will grow as it levels the cities of the foolish nations that oppose it.

#selectmonster 2784 -- Thrice Horned Boar
#descr "Born at the dawn of time the Thrice Horned Boar represents an earlier era, when monsters and giants roamed the world. As a creature of unbridled fury and a manifestation of rage and fertility it was worshiped by the first of men as a god of war and the hunt. Thrice blessed by the previous Pantokrator it became his herald, warrior and general when he brought order to the world. When the work of the Pantokrator was finished he imprisoned and banished all that threatened his creation and the Golden Boar was deemed too unruly to remain in Creation. The Crested Boar was forever imprisoned in the forest of the Horned One where he found an ally with a temperament resembling his own. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the Thrice Horned Boar of War is breaking free to lead his followers in peace and war. A crest of bristles, golden skin and three horns on the forehead sets the Thrice Horned Boar apart as a divine being with powers far surpassing the monstrous boars that sometimes appear in the lands of men. As the Dominion of the Boar grows strong its lesser kin will emerge in great numbers to serve it. The presence of the Thrice Horned Boar will cause all friendly animals present to become filled with rage and gain in size and strength.

Casts Spirit of the Boar in battles (All friendly animals present become enlarged and go berserk)

Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the shackles of the Solar Eagle are weakening and he will once more be free to claim the world as his. The Solar Eagle is surrounded by an aura of solar brilliance given him by the Pantokrator as a messenger of the Sun and is able to rise up to the heavens and burn away old age, sickness and old wounds.

When the previous Pantokrator rose to power he made the Raven a herald of death and slaughter and gave it powers of farsight and foresight. The raven was tasked with guiding the dead to the underworld and it became wise in the ways of death. But the Raven grew too close to death and the Pantokrator was afraid that it served the Lord of the Underworld rather than himself. The Pantokrator banished the great bird for eternity. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the Herald of Death and Slaughter can return to the world of men and bring whispers of death to come. The Raven of the Underworld feeds on the dead and regains hit points if enough corpses are present. The sight of the Raven is a bad omen and any that harm it in battle may be cursed with ill fortune. As the raven feasts it will grow in strength and will gain knowledge of death and the underworld.

Will grow as eats corpses and gain abilities.

It is a strange being of two conflicting natures, those of a great lion and a monstrous ant. It is plagued by a ravenous hunger and a foul mood, as the ant part of the monster is unable to digest what the lion part devours. Thus the beast is always hungry and always furious. When the previous Pantokrator rose to power he imprisoned and banished all that threatened his creation. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the raging Ant Lion will once more try to satisfy his hunger. The Ant Lion is surrounded by swarms of ants large and small, and in battle they will hinder and attack its enemies. Ants will crawl from their nests to serve their master, each month more Ants appearing as the Myrmecoleons Dominion grows strong, including powerful Queen Ants.

When the previous Pantokrator rose to power he imprisoned and banished all that threatened his creation and the Earth Serpent was imprisoned for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the shackles are weakening and the tremors of the stirring serpent can once more be felt in the world. Great Serpents can shed their skin and regenerate their wounds. The Earth Serpent is slow, as is its metabolism and life cycle. It doesn't regenerate as quickly as other serpents, but given time, all of its wounds will heal. The Earth Serpents ungainly movement causes great tremors which will harm enemies and friendly soldiers in battle unless they are able to fly. During a siege the tremors will rock the defending fortifications with quakes that will act with the strength of 100 normal men, and any fort in the same province as the Earth Serpent may even totally collapse due to the shaking ground.

It is the eternal enemy of the Serpent of Chaos, another primordial monster, and was rewarded by the Pantokrator with an aura of solar splendor. During the rebellion of the lesser gods the great serpent fought against the Great Antagonist and the Serpent of Chaos. When the Antagonist was defeated he spelled a curse that banished the Pantokrator's servants and the Solar Serpent was unable to remain in creation. Now, with the waning of the old decrees, the Solar Serpent and the Serpent of Chaos are preparing to once more bring the primordial battle of light and dark to creation. At the temples of the serpent great snakes are raised, and when the sun shines on the temple ground sometimes one will begin to radiate incredible heat. These Fire Snakes are seen as gifts from the Solar Serpent. Great Serpents can shed their skin and regenerate their wounds, and the Solar Serpent is no exception.

The Serpent of Darkness was finally defeated by the son of the slain Pantokrator and banished for eternity. Now, with the waning of the old decrees, the Serpent of Chaos and the Solar Serpent are preparing to once more bring the primordial battle of light and dark to creation. The Serpent is surrounded at all times by total darkness that hides its movements and appearance. This darkness is so complete that soldiers cannot see their hand in front of their face. Great Serpents can shed their skin and regenerate their wounds, and the Serpent of Chaos is no exception. It is attended by shadowy servants from the realm of darkness and more will appear to serve it as its Dominion grows strong.

#descr "The Linnormr is a monstrous reptile born at the dawn of time, when monsters and giants roamed the world. It is surrounded by noxious fumes that slay plant and beast alike. The very land where the Great Serpent dwelled withered and died. It made its home beneath the World Tree and gnawed on its roots, threatening to destroy the world. When the previous Pantokrator rose to power he imprisoned and banished all that threatened his creation and the Linnormr was imprisoned for eternity, lest the World Tree would wither and the world with it. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the shackles are weakening and the noxious fumes of the horrible serpent can once more be felt in the world. The fumes will fill any battlefield where the Linnormr is present, and will quickly kill any unprotected soldiers there. Should a Mother Oak be planted the beast will gnaw at the roots of the tree once more, reducing the gems created and gaining Death gems in the process. The followers of the Linnormr will be protected from the fumes.

If Mother Oak is cast the owner loses 2D6 N gems each month and Linnorm gains 2D6 D gems
Blessing gains Poison Resist 15 when Awakens
When Linnorm is at a Throne will generate 9D6 D gems once each year

#descr "The Demiurge is a great serpent created at the dawn of time, when monsters and giants roamed the world. It is the progeny of the daughter of a previous Pantokrator. Her misguided attempt at creation resulted in a primordial monster wreathed in divine splendour. The monstrous serpent beheld the world and all its inferior beings. Full of unbridled pride he roared towards the sky and claimed to be the One True God and creator of everything, unaware of the Pantokrator and the true order of the world. The Pantokrator decided to rid the world of the False God and imprisoned him for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone the Blind God is slowly awakening, free to once more claim the world as his to rule. His hubris is so great that it will overpower the Dominion of the weak, false Gods that oppose him. The priests of the Demiurge confidently declare the other Pretenders false and weak, sure in the power of their Lord.

Priests gain Amulet of Conviction (Autoblessed, Inquisitor)

#descr "The Serpent of Heavenly Fires is a serpentine entity spawned at the dawn of time when lightning struck the sun. The serpent was approached by a demi-god given power over winds and weather by a previous Pantokrator. The pair mated and the Mother of Storms gave birth to the first storm. Frightened and cowed, the first men began to worship the couple to be spared from their wrath and receive their blessings. The Pantokrator was furious and imprisoned them under the mountains for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone the serpent is breaking free from his prison, ready to unleash thunder and storms upon the world in search of his imprisoned mate. His priests can call lightning from the skies and the Serpent will answer.

Unable to abandon his task his curiosity and interest in the world from whence the souls of the dead come has grown over the millennia.

Donning a godly mantle, it has taken the role of a Pretender God. The Mage heard tales of huge amounts of death magic locked in the deep ocean and has ventured into the deeps in search of this bounty. Animating the corpse of a rotting asp turtle, he uses the huge size and heavy armor of the beast to kill smaller beings by trampling them. Through the power of undeath it can leave the waters, however the rotting hulk will be slow above the waves. The Lacedon Mage is a master of magic and can be adept in several magic paths. As his Dominion spreads he will reach out across his Dominion and wherever Death scales touch the land he will reanimate those slain. 

Starting Item: Rod of Death
UW Provinces with Death scales may spawn 1D3 Drowned Soulless (Candles x 5% chance)
UW Temples in Death scales may also spawn 1D3 soulless & 1 Ghost (Candles x 10% chance)
Whilst controls Remnants in the Depths, UW provinces with Death scales generate 1D3 Ghosts/month and 10% x candles chance of a Leviathan

Through long study of ancient texts she has attained such power that she has mastered her own mortality. Now, with her people threatened by subjugation she has donned a godly mantle and taken the role of a Pretender Goddess. A formidable elementalist, her distinct talent is for creating power through innovation, efficiency, and strategy. She has developed methods to not only control raging floods and fires, but also to use them to irrigate the fields and clear new land. Each month a population under her dominion will permanently increase their local province in fertility and productivity. She can use the lore of the elements to predict disasters and other bad events and will put in place measures to prevent them. The Divine Sage Empress is a master of elemental magic and rituals, able to cast more powerful elemental spells and magical rituals.

Within his Dominion troop movements can be seen in great detail and enemy illusions and phantasms are dispelled on the battlefield. Patrolling units will find it much easier to detect enemy scouts and to quell unrest. The historic records for all nations can be accessed and everyone on the Hall of Fame can be inspected. He can also extend his senses through this network to allow him to cast spells at a range far beyond that of most spellcasters.

The second Pure One embodies all the power of the Earthly plane and is skilled in the magic of Earth. The third Pure One embodies the power inherent in living creatures and is skilled in all other paths of magic. Each of them holds a divine object representing their power and authority. One holds the Pearl of Creation, one the Ruyi of Power and one the Fan of Knowledge. Each can call the others using their divine power. Since the disappearance of the Pantokrator the Pure Ones have taken on the mantle of Pretender Gods, to lead their followers to the Throne of Heaven and to reclaim what was once theirs.

He is a master of natural magic and has studied other paths. The Arch Druid knows how to awaken the magical inhabitants of the forests and summons four extra vine men or vine ogres when casting the appropriate ritual spell. Vine men will begin to reawaken from their slumber as his Dominion grows strong. The Druid carries an enchanted thistle mace that aids him in casting spells of Nature magic. Unless dormant or imprisoned he will build a dwelling in the capital where mages of nature and animism will gather to hear his teachings. The Druid prefers to dwell in forested provinces, and whilst roaming the wilds in such a province may create great fortifications of vines and brambles.

#descr "The Partholonians were once the rulers of the Sauromatian lands, but have long since vanished. Their sacred bones lie buried in tombs in the Sauromatian swamps. In the mists of the marshland lies the castle of Delgnat. Here the longdead kin of the last Partholonian walk the halls and feast on pomegranates of the dead, reanimated by the dark sorcery of Delgnat in her vain attempts to escape solitude. Ancient bones in ancient armor are forced to masquerade as the living to appease their lady. The lords of ancient Partholon were buried with their fey steeds, given antler headpieces in imitation of the deer that escort souls to the Underworld. The Lords retain their minds and so their skill with illusions and Air magic. Once great warrior poets, now they only recite ancient verse and relive long lost glories in Delgnat's empty halls."

She has learned of the resting places of her descendants, the Nemedians, and through dark sorcery will cause their bones to rise once more.

The two of them acquired great knowledge of magic through the centuries and their skills were unsurpassed. But the younger brother didn't have the proper mindset to become a true master smith, and with passing centuries the eldest dwarf surpassed his younger brother in all but pride. One day the younger brother stole most of their collected treasures and fled into the wild. There he transformed into a Linnormr to protect his stolen treasures. The eldest dwarf tried to regain his stolen gold, but the dragon was too powerful. Instead he forged magical weapons and gave them to the heroes of men so that they would slay his brother. Recently he gave up his of schemes of vengeance and decided to turn his crafts to a greater challenge. He would craft himself a godly mantle and claim the world as his. Upon awakening he will create a great steel forge in the capital that will provide resources and allow great works of magical construction.

#descr "This ancient Svartalf is the younger brother of the Eldest Dwarf. Together the two of them learned and mastered their arts of smithing and artifice. But the younger brother did not have the temperament to become as skilled as his brother. As the centuries passed he observed as his brother forged increasingly beautiful artifacts. In jealous rage he stole his brother's most prized possession and fled into the wilderness. He became obsessed with greed and transformed himself into a horrible Linnormr in order to protect his treasures from his elder brother. But the elder brother didn't follow him. Instead he forged mighty weapons and gave them to the heroes of men to challenge and slay his brother, the dragon-dwarf. With the death of the last hero, the dragon-dwarf got tired of the hiding game. Now he has returned to the world of men to claim it as his and slay his brother so no one will try to take his precious treasures from him. When in Linnormr shape his physical might is unrivaled, but his magical powers are drastically reduced.

#descr "The Voidborn are strange Illithids born since the coming of the Firstborn of the Star. Like all Illithids they resemble a pink mass of writhing tentacles wearing robes made of strange flowing materials. The mere touch of an Illithid sucks the life force out of living beings, however the Voidborn are even more dangerous. They can quickly drain the life from even large beings and use it to heal wounds, whilst a strange aura surrounds them that protects them from harm and disorients all those not familiar with the void. Their mental powers appear to be focused inwards and so they cannot blast the minds of weaker beings as normal Illithids can. All Illithids are amphibious."

#descr "The Grey Ones, Graeae, are three crone sisters spawned by Phorkys, Father of Monsters, at the dawn of time. When the Pantokrator reformed the world he slew or banished all monsters that threatened the world. The Graeae, while not nearly as powerful as their father, were imprisoned and chained in a stygian cavern as a precaution. For millennia the crones have waited, getting older and angrier for every year that passed. Now with the Pantokrator gone, their shackles are weakening and their malice can be felt by those who dream. The Grey Ones are incredibly old and their bodies are frail and weak. Two of the sisters have lost their eyesight and now the three of them share a single eye. All three sisters use death and water magic, but they have all mastered different magical paths. The first of the Sisters, 'the Terrible', uses blood and nature magic. The second sister, known as 'the Warlike' uses fire and earth magic and the third sister, 'the Destroyer' uses air and astral magic.

Trinity God - Grey One x 3
All have halved D/W/G, First has full B/N, second has full F/E, last has full A/S
